***Orientation***
I can get axes of symmetry, but cannot detect top from bottom. May be easier and better with nn than heuristic
***Spacing***
How can I make sure spaces between objects are appropriate?
One technique would be to find a concave hull, then find local minima or radius. I could also use width of bounding boxes, but I want items to infringe on bounding rectangles
