~~Design Choices~~
We can either use pycairo and create our own functions for creating triangles, etc. and keeping track of the shapes s
I want to be able to objects relative to other objects, get objects center, top, etc. I do not think pycairo out the box supports dealing with objects ala inkscape, it seems that it simply draws to context. 

~Language options~
Python: I know it, I like it. Most of my projects are (will be?) in python, so it is better for interfacing
JS: Good for web stuff, has more developed libraries. Can we use this for Unity graphics, more easily than python?
~SVG Library Options~
Python:
	pycairo
	cairocffi
		neither of the above support the level of object-orientedness I want.
	svgwrite
		Still being updated and maintaned. 
JS:
	Snap.svg
		Written by OG JS SVG library author. Made for modern browsers, uses fancy SVG stuff. Can read inkscape, illustrator, etc. files. Supports animation. Object oriented in the way I want.
		Cons: Hasn't been updated since 2017
	paperjs
		Actively maintained
