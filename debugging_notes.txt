I added get_axis_of_symmetry() to mandala_utils.js.
When I call it in a callback to load_pieces, it does not execute as evidenced by the lack of print statements.
When I call it in the html outside

the imported items are blocked by a plane starting around x=200. What is it?
items created in the html file work fine, as do items in the simple_flower function
I don't think it's a layer issue, I've tried using the main layer
What is the difference between imported and created paths?

It looks like the imported items are contained in a group item that is clipped. Moving the group item moves them all
The group has 2 children. Moving either child moves the whole group
Moving the group's position moves each of the children's position. The positions are offset by 0 and ~5.2
