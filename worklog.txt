How to find bilateral symmetry: consider all (or half) of the vertices and points halway along paths between adjacent vertices (verbose). The axis of symmetry must be between a pair of such points. 
	How to test that candidate axis is indeed axis: 
		Copy item and reflect across axis. Check that it is identical by one of:
			path definitions (probs not unique, may be mirrored?)
			overlapping area being equal to area of each (makes it easy to find approximate symmetry by adding error tolerance)
